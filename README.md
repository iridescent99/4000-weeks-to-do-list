# 4000 Weeks Task Management System
A task management system inspired by Oliver Burkeman's "4000 Weeks".


### Who is it for?
For anyone who has lost oversight of all their to do's because they have been spread over too many files, or someone who is looking for more compartmentalization between the different types of to do's.
This app also brings focus to a narrow set of current to do's, without limiting the user's ability to continuously add new to do's.


This plugin has several components, which all can be turned off and on depending on the user's preferences.

This includes a categorized open to do list, with an interface. The purpose of this is to add any task that comes to mind. The categories can be customized. The interface allows you to add, delete, batch-add, or move tasks to the closed list.
Then there is the closed to do list, which contains the tasks you're focusing on at the current time. You can set a maximum for this list if desired. Checking off items on the closed to do list will place add them to the archived file with a completion date.

## Open To Do Lists

The root for the open to do lists will be a folder. Every file inside that that folder (no matter how deep) will be regarded as a category.
Double clicking a list item will add it to the closed to list. If an item is already present in the closed to do list, it will have an italic font style.
